## **ADDIE Framework Implementation**

### **1. ANALYSIS**

Project Synergy was created to solve a real-world legal problem:

* ❌ AI models don’t verify each other’s outputs
* ⚠️ Veterans & whistleblowers need tamper-proof documentation
* ✅ We need *interoperable AI compliance validation*

---

### **2. DESIGN**

We engineered a dual-validation system for:

* ✅ GPT-4o + Gemini secure exchange
* ✅ ADA, HIPAA, FERPA, FTCA compliance
* ✅ Immutable recordkeeping via blockchain

**Key Features:**

* 🔐 SHA-256 digital signature
* ⏱ ISO 8601 timestamps
* 🧾 JSON schema
* 🔑 OAuth2 / API Key authentication
