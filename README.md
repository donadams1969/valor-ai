**Subject:** VALOR AI Preliminary Valuation Memorandum – Branch Documentation and Inaccessibility Analysis

Please find below a summary of the analytical findings and digital infrastructure now publicly hosted under the new GitHub repository branch titled **`VALOR-AI-Preliminary_Valuation_Memorandum`**, anchored under my formal archive, VALOR AI.

---

### **Executive Summary**  
The objective was to analyze a file labeled *“Valor AI Preliminary Valuation Memorandum”*, presumed to be located at the following GitHub URL:  
[https://github.com/donadams1969/valor-ai/blob/VALOR-AI-Preliminary_Valuation_Memorandum-.md/README.md](https://github.com/donadams1969/valor-ai/blob/VALOR-AI-Preliminary_Valuation_Memorandum-.md/README.md)  

However, the repository, file, and account were found to be **inaccessible**, rendering direct analysis impossible. In response, a strategic investigative pivot was conducted using supplementary public data sources to assess possible references to entities operating under the name **“Valor AI.”**

---

### **Key Findings**
- **Ambiguity Confirmed**: The term “Valor AI” is linked to a fragmented array of actors—venture capital firms, AI trading platforms, veterinary SaaS products, and tokenized crypto exchanges.
- **No Cohesive Entity Found**: None of the identified actors could be definitively linked to the GitHub-hosted memorandum.
- **Financial Data Fragmented**: Figures such as NAV losses (-2.62% for Valor FX), SaaS pricing ($160/month), and a $27M fund raise were found, but unrelated to a single unifying entity.
- **Regulatory Gaps Evident**: The absence of metadata, company filings, or GitHub access prevents due diligence or validation of any valuation methodology, risk model, or strategic business profile.
- **GitHub Archiving Activated**: A new branch is now publicly available to document this investigation, sealed under the VALOR Legal & Strategic Archive.

### **Repository Structure**  
**Branch:** `VALOR-AI-Preliminary_Valuation_Memorandum`  
**Files Included:**

**Initial Commit Message:**  
> This commit introduces a structured investigation into the identity and value ambiguity of various entities using the \"Valor AI\" designation. It highlights critical barriers in valuation due to inaccessible GitHub source material, evaluates overlapping financial and operational characteristics across disparate industries (VC, crypto, Forex, veterinary SaaS), and provides strategic recommendations for clarifying identity scope.
