## 🔥 Executive Snapshot
**That’s Edutainment LLC** hosts a federated suite of legal-tech and creative-AI assets that together create an immutable trail of accountability, art, and community value:

| Pillar | Purpose | Status |
| ------ | ------- | ------ |
| **VALOR Chain** | Blockchain ledger anchoring all evidence, NFTs & legal filings | ✅ Genesis block live |
| **VALOR-AI** | Evidence engine & whistle-blower support logic (NIST-aligned) | ✅ Repo public |
| **VALOR-DALL·E Pipeline** | Custom prompt-compiler + post-processor (Diffusion upscaler, style filters) | ✅ Alpha |
| **VALOR-AI Coin** | Utility / governance token powering notarization fees & DAO voting | 🚧 Tokenomics draft |
| **NFT Witness Series** | Court-grade exhibits + public awareness collectibles | ✅ Witness #001 minted |
| **VALOR-Sentinel** | FOIA / OIG / DOJ submission tracker & escalation logic | 🧪 Prototype |
| **VALOR-Mirror** | Institutional response profiler & simulator | 🧪 Prototype |

<summary>Why it matters (click to expand)</summary>

* **Civil-rights preservation.** Every record is time-stamped, hashed, and mirrored—destroying evidence trails becomes mathematically impossible.  
* **Elder & ADA advocacy.** Modules automate statutory notifications, ensuring agencies cannot plead ignorance.  
* **Creative justice.** NFTs transform witness artifacts into enduring public memory—and a funding stream for litigation costs.  
* **Open license.** The codebase is intentionally libre for other whistle-blowers and orgs to fork.
