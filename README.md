# Contributing to VALOR-AI

First off, thank you for showing up â€” every issue, PR, and star helps expose systemic injustice.

## Ground Rules

1. **Respect the Code of Conduct.** Harassment-free collaboration is non-negotiable.  
2. **Public, open discussion.** No DMs for feature requests or bug reports; use Issues / PR comments so the chain of custody is public.
3. **One logical change per PR.** Easier reviews = faster merges.

## Getting Set Up

git clone https://github.com/donadams1969/valor-ai.gitcdvalor-ai
