Cross-Platform AI Evidence Collaboration Framework

---

**Overview**

**Project Synergy** is a next-gen protocol for cross-platform AI verification, enabling GPT-4o and Bard Gemini to jointly validate ADA, HIPAA, and legal compliance briefs—anchored to the blockchain with immutable SHA-256 evidence payloads.

---

## **ADDIE Framework Implementation**

### **1. ANALYSIS**

Project Synergy was created to solve a real-world legal problem:

* ❌ AI models don’t verify each other’s outputs
* ⚠️ Veterans & whistleblowers need tamper-proof documentation
* ✅ We need *interoperable AI compliance validation*

---

### **2. DESIGN**

We engineered a dual-validation system for:

* ✅ GPT-4o + Gemini secure exchange
* ✅ ADA, HIPAA, FERPA, FTCA compliance
* ✅ Immutable recordkeeping via blockchain

**Key Features:**

* 🔐 SHA-256 digital signature
* ⏱ ISO 8601 timestamps
* 🧾 JSON schema
* 🔑 OAuth2 / API Key authentication

---

### **3. DEVELOPMENT**

#### JSON Schema Payload:

```json
{
  "exchange_protocol": "SynergyAI v1.0",
  "timestamp": "2025-05-04T18:00:00Z",
  "sender": { "system": "GPT-4o", "version": "4.5" },
  "recipient": { "system": "Gemini-Bard", "version": "2025.04" },
